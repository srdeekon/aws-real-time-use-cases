# Application Modernisation Objectives (WorkInProgress)

## 🔥 Scenario

Miztiik Unicorn is embarking on a journey to modernize their monolithic legacy application. They have one big binary that is difficult to update and roll out of this update takes a lot of downtime. As a result of the slow release of new features, they are looking market share. Their sales and marketing team are having a hard time to get an new products to customers. On the operational side, the teams are constantly working to make the sure the server stays online rather than focussing on improving the operations.

Can you help them to think how to modernize their application to meet growing demands?

## 🎯Solutions

### Modernization Goals

- **Best Practices:** Teach us best practices – tell us the “right” way and “best” way; if, for some reason, we cannot do this, we will tell you.
- **Operational Excellence**
  – **Continuous Integration & Deployment**:

  1. How to deploy faster, reduce cycle time to market, improve customer experience
  1. Focus on Blue-Green deployments to streamline DevOps
  1. Monitoring in a holistic way to get a view of entire business process rather than servers,storage and networks etc.

- **Cost Optimization**: Keep costs as low as possible

  1. Reduce proprietary products and license costs or trade in for open source products
