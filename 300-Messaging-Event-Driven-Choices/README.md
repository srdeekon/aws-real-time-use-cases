# What are my choices for event routers in AWS & When to choose them?

## 🔥 Scenario

When you are developing new applications, one of the common questions that comes up is that, What are the choices you have and When to choose say SQS or SNS or EventBridge or Kinesis etc

## 🎯Solutions

Both SNS and SQS have their own benefits and are ideally suited for specific needs. It is not an either of choice, rather it is about choosing the right tool for the right job.

Here is a simple decision tree that makes it easier for new developers to get them thinking about the requirements that are important to them and follow along that path.

For example, If your architecture requires `fan-out` and `rate limiting` you can use a combination of both SNS (for fanout) and SQS (for rate limiting)

## 📌 Who is using this

This repository teaches developers, Solution Architects & Ops Engineers how to build complete architecture in AWS. Based on that knowledge these Udemy [course #1][103], [course #2][102] have been created to enhance your skills.
